# Topics Page Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the new "Topics" navigation page added to the Workout Timer application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Navigation Enhancement
- Added "topics" to the `MODES` tuple in `WorkoutTimerApp` class
- Position: Between "custom" and "settings" for logical grouping
- Updated navigation icons dictionary to include topics icon

### 2. New TopicsForm Component
- Created `TopicsForm` class in `gui/components/forms.py`
- Inherits from `BaseModeForm` for consistency
- Features a scrollable content area with educational information
- Includes sections on:
  - Tabata Training
  - Boxing Training  
  - Custom Workouts
  - General Tips

### 3. Application Integration
- Added TopicsForm import to main app module
- Integrated topics form into the forms dictionary
- Updated `_show_mode()` method to handle topics mode
- Modified `_update_totals()` and `_on_start()` to treat topics like settings (non-timer page)

### 4. Assets
- Added `topics.png` icon to `assets/icons/` directory
- Created by copying existing `custom.png` icon

### 5. Code Structure
- Topics page behaves like the Settings page (no timer functionality)
- Returns empty phases list from `estimate_phases()` method  
- Control panel buttons are disabled when topics page is active
- Summary frame is hidden when topics page is selected

## User Experience

When users click on the "Topics" navigation item, they will see:
- Timer display shows "Topics" mode with "00:00" time
- Educational content in a scrollable format
- Information about different workout types and general fitness tips
- No timer controls (Start/Stop/Reset buttons are disabled)
- Clean, readable layout with proper typography

## Testing

A test script (`test_topics.py`) has been created to verify:
- Correct imports and class structure
- Proper integration with the navigation system
- Required methods and file changes
- Positioning in the navigation order

## Future Enhancements

The Topics page structure allows for easy expansion:
- Additional workout information
- Links to external resources
- Interactive elements
- Images or diagrams
- Video tutorials (when supported)

## Files Modified

1. `gui/app.py` - Main application integration
2. `gui/components/forms.py` - TopicsForm implementation
3. `assets/icons/topics.png` - Navigation icon
4. `.gitignore` - Added to prevent cache file commits

## Minimal Change Approach

This implementation follows minimal change principles by:
- Reusing existing patterns (BaseModeForm inheritance)
- Following established navigation system
- Using consistent styling and layout
- Not modifying core timer functionality
- Maintaining backward compatibility
