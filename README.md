# Workout Timer

Python application for managing workout sessions with a simple terminal countdown. The project will eventually use `customtkinter` for a modern GUI, but for now it offers only a basic console timer.

## Quick Start

```bash
python main.py 45 --label "Warm-up"
```

The command above starts a 45-second countdown and displays the optional label.
